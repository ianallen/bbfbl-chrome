### **Scoring**  {#scoring}

The league will use 9 Category Rotisserie scoring per [Yahoo\! Fantasy Sports](https://baseball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/b1/proleagues_rules).

**Roster Size:** 12	  
**Concurrent Active Players:** 10  
**Minimum Players on Roster**: 10  
**Categories:**

* FG%  
* FT%  
* Three Pointers Made  
* Points  
* Rebounds  
* Assists  
* Steals  
* Blocks  
* Turnovers

**Active Player Positions:** PG, SG, G, SF, PF, F, C, Util, Util, Util  
**Max Games per position:** 80

The Boom Boom Fantasy Basketball League (BBFBL) League will end one week before the NBA Season ends: **4/5/26**. 

### **Salary Cap** {#salary-cap}

The league will have both a soft and hard salary cap. Roster cost will be based on the player’s actual salaries rounded to the nearest cent. So, a 27 mil a year contract is worth $27 dollars. A 6.52 million dollar contract will be worth $6.52. The source of record for contracts will be [Sportrac](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/contracts/) (“cap hit”) and [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html) as a fallback. In the case that a player’s salary changes mid-season (e.g. renegotiation, buyout and re-sign with a new team), the new salary will come into effect when it is no longer deemed “estimated” by Sportrac. 

Every year, the soft cap will move with the actual NBA soft salary cap / 1 million (For simplicity, the League Office reserves the right to round the soft cap value to the nearest sensible value. The current NBA Salary cap is **$154.65 Million**). The hard cap will be the soft cap \+ 30%. 

The soft cap for the 2025-2026 BBFBL will be **$155** for rosters and the hard cap **$201.5.**

Exceeding  the soft cap ($155) will result in a tax. Exceeding The hard cap ($201.5) will result in a $5 fine per day exceeded, loss of one game from the games played cap per day exceeded, and lock of team for  days (locks applied for multiple offenses with the number of days based on the number of times the salary cap has been contravened that year). Please do not exceed the hard cap. Although it can happen inadvertently, it is unfair to the other owners. Please monitor your team salaries accordingly.

A player counts against an owner’s team salary once the first game of the day has been played. For example, Player 1 picks up John Wall on Monday. John Wall does not have a game until Wednesday night. Player 1 drops John Wall on Tuesday morning. John Wall’s salary does count against Player 1’s salary once any NBA game is played on Monday.

To drop players you owe the league their contract. i.e. you drop a player who drops your team salary from $165 to $160. Your team cap ceiling becomes $165 for all transactions and you still owe the tax for $165.

If you are over at the end of the draft you have to get under in the usual manner. You however are not allowed to pick up any players until 24 hours after you get back under the hard cap based on the players drafted. ie you need to make your drops and then wait before playing the wire. 

Once a team has paid the taxes associated with their max salary number, that tax is no longer owed. For example:

Team ABC has a team salary of $165. After making a trade your team salary becomes $158. Team ABC then makes a waiver wire pickup and their team salary goes back up to $162. No money is owed since the tax for being at $165 was already previously paid.

#### **Tax Rates** {#tax-rates}

**First Apron ceiling \= Soft cap \+ 15%**: Salary added resulting in a team salary from **$155 \- $178.25** will be charged a Luxury Tax Rate of **x1.5**

**Second Apron ceiling \= soft cap \+ 30%**: Salary added resulting in a team salary from **$178.25-$201.50** will be charged a Luxury Tax Rate of **x2**

### **Fee Collection Schedule** {#fee-collection-schedule}

All teams pay the whole fee associated with having a roster at the hard cap at the beginning of the year or make a payment plan with the league. If you do not hit the hard cap during the season, you will be reimbursed at the end of the season. Teams to be locked otherwise.

The buy in for the league is equal to the full tax due from hitting the hard cap. This year the buy-in is **($236.50)**. The buy-in is required to hold your spot in the league and will be due prior to the draft.

League Fees can be collected over the course of the year on a monthly basis. Each league member will receive an invoice during the first week of each month for the transaction made the previous month.

All monthly fees must be paid off within 14 days of receiving the invoice. Failure to pay off fees will result in a roster lock.

**Last Place Penalty**  
The team that finishes in last place must pay a fee of $30. That $30 fee will be used to buy and ship a championship trophy to our league winner.  

### **Payout** {#payout}

The top three teams according to aggregate rotisserie points across the 9 categories win a percentage of the pot. The payout structure is as follows:

| Rank | Percent of Pot |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | 59% |
| 2 | 24% |
| 3 | 13% |

(League Office league maintenance fee of 4% of league fees)

### **Keepers** {#keepers}

After each season, owners can select up to 3 players to keep on their roster for the following year. A player can be kept only two consecutive years in a row before having to be released back into the draft pool. For example: Player X drafts Lonzo Ball in 2018, Player X can keep Ball for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, but cannot keep Ball beyond the 2020-2021 season.

Teams get one keeper change due to injury between keeper selection and league draft.

Keeper status transfers with all transactions. So, if an owner  drafts LeBron James in this year’s draft. The owner keeps him next year and then at some point next year trade him to Team B. LeBron only has 1 year of keeper eligibility left with Team B.  

### **Transactions** {#transactions}

~~50 free transactions per team. All transactions after the 50 count will be taxed at a rate of **20 cents per transaction**.~~

Trading draft picks is allowed, but trading away a pick within the first 4 rounds (and not getting a higher draft pick in return within the transaction) incurs a tax that goes towards a down payment on the **next season’s** **buy-in**. The tax rate is as follows:

* **25%** of current buy-in if own **1st** round pick traded  
* **20%** of current buy-in if own **2nd** round pick traded  
* **15%** of current buy-in if own **3rd** round pick traded  
* **10%** of current buy-in if own **4th** round pick traded

Trades involving keepers and draft picks can be made before draft during the period after keepers are selected. These “handshake” deal have to be reported to the League Office and both teams must acknowledge it in the email sent to [BBBasketball321@gmail.com](mailto:BBBasketball321@gmail.com)

All league members are required to provide at the start of the season their primary and secondary method of communication for trade discussions.

#### **Cash Considerations** {#cash-considerations}

Cash considerations can be included as part of a trade as long as it is reported to the League Office within an hour of the acceptance of the trade. Cash considerations that can be offered and accepted as part of a trade are capped according to the following rules:

* **Max payout in cash considerations per team** per season will be 1/2 the softcap **($77.50 in 2025-26)**  
* **Max in-take in cash considerations per team** per season will be the league buy-in **($236.50 in 2025-26)**  
* ~~Max cash payout per trade will be 1/2 the league buy-in **($118.25 in 2025-26)**~~

[**The Cash Considerations tracker can be found here.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/165RsSB_lhX69GOH7bcRgSR2V418z-PFnE4edbAjduH4/edit?usp=sharing) 

### Draft and Lottery {#draft-and-lottery}

Before the start of each season, owners will assemble their rosters via a snake draft. To determine the draft order, a draft lottery will be conducted for the teams that ended the season outside of the top four.

The odds to win the first overall pick in the draft is directly tied to standings season standings (4th place team has best odds, last place team has worst odds). The odds for the entire lottery are as follows:

* 4th place: 32%  
* 5th place: 22%  
* 6th place: 15%  
* 7th place: 10%  
* 8th place: 6%  
* 9th place: 5%  
* 10th place: 4%  
* 11th place: 3%  
* 12th place: 2%  
* 13th place: 1%

Odds only used in the lottery to dictate picks 1-3, similar to the actual NBA. The remaining picks (4-10) would then be assigned based on the teams order in the standings.

The final three picks will be reserved for the money winning teams in reverse ranking order (1st place gets the last pick).

### Collective Bargaining {#collective-bargaining}

A Collective bargaining period will precede every season. In order to pass a motion, 75% of league members are required to vote and 75% or more of those voting are required to pass the motion. The League office holds 2 veto votes.

### Competitive Balance {#competitive-balance}

There is a 730 games played minimum for every team. Teams that do not reach the minimum floor at the end of the season automatically pick at the end of the first round (after the lottery and money teams) during the following season’s draft. 

If a team does not meet the minimum games played for two years in a row, the league gets to vote on whether the team manager remains in the league or is forced to vacate their team. 

Commissioners’ Office reserves the right to remove a team from the league at the end of the season. That team can be saved if 100% of the league (excluding commissioners) vote to keep them. 

Due to COVID 19, we’ve temporarily added an additional IR spot but the second IR spot is reserved only for players quarantined due to COVID-19. That player's salary would not count towards the salary cap but can only be on the IR slot starting the day a player tests positives and must be removed from IR as soon as he's cleared to play.

### League Expansion  {#league-expansion}

In the event that we add a new team, that team will be added via vote and consensus is needed to add. Each team designates their 3 keepers and the new team gets to choose from remaining rostered players (so they can't pick up players currently a free agent). Their draft order will come after the "lottery teams". 

The incoming team will receive a 25% discount on the league buy-in for year 1\.
